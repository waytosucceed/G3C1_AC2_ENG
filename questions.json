    "options": ["Yes", "No"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "In the sentence 'Mary was a spirited and inquisitive child,' the word 'Mary' is used as a proper noun. Proper nouns are specific names given to particular people, places, or things. In this case, 'Mary' is the name of a person, so it functions as a noun. Additionally, proper nouns are always capitalized, which is consistent with the capitalization of 'Mary' in the sentence. Therefore, 'Mary' is indeed a noun."

    "explanation": "A concrete noun is a word that represents a physical object or substance that can be perceived by the senses. In the given sentence, 'Mary' and 'garden' are concrete nouns because they represent tangible entities that can be seen, touched, or experienced. 'Mary' refers to a specific person, and a person is a concrete entity. 'Garden' refers to a physical outdoor space with plants and possibly structures, making it a concrete noun. Regarding the relationship between proper nouns and concrete nouns: All proper nouns and common nouns are concrete nouns because they refer to specific, tangible entities. For example, 'Mary' is a proper noun representing a specific person, and 'garden' is a common noun representing a specific physical space. However, not all concrete nouns are proper nouns or common nouns. Concrete nouns encompass a broader category of tangible objects, including common nouns like 'table,' 'book,' 'tree,' etc. These nouns represent general categories of physical objects rather than specific individuals or places. Proper nouns, on the other hand, specifically identify unique individuals, places, or things and always begin with a capital letter."
